Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring
</h1>
<i>
based on the book by J.R.R. Tolkien and movie by Peter Jackson
</i>
<br>
<b>
Atari VCS version by One Of The Bruces
</b>
<h2>
Introduction
</h2>
In this game, you play the role of Frodo Baggins, hobbit and inadvertent
Ringbearer. Your mission is explained in the introductory screens of
the game: you must take the Ring to the Inn of the Prancing Pony in
Bree, where you will meet the wizard Gandalf and deliver the Ring into
his care.
<p>You may well find the game more rewarding if you've read
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> by J.R.R. Tolkien. If that's too taxing for
you, at least try to see the movie.<p>
Please note that the Parker Brothers Atari VCS cartridge <a href="https://atariage.com/features/lotr/"><i>Lord of the Rings:
Journey to Rivendell</i></a>, although admittedly featuring graphics and
actual gameplay, uses twice the memory to get you half as far in the
story.<p>
<h2>
Controlling the Game
</h2>
<b>Instructions for the Stupid</b>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that the Atari VCS is turned OFF. That means "not on." The
leftmost switch on the console, the one that says "power," should be in
the DOWN position. That's next to the label that says "off." Got it?
Just in case:
<hr>
<table bgcolor=#eeffee>
<tr><td>
NOTE: To prolong the life of your Atari Video Computer System and to
protect the electronic components, the console should be OFF when
inserting or removing a Game Program.
</td></tr>
</table>

<table bgcolor=#ffffee>
<tr><td>
NOTE: The preceding note was taken verbatim from the <i>Adventure</i>
instruction manual. I think it's right up there with "Do not expose
LaserWriter to open flame" in the "well, duh" category.
</td></tr>
</table>
<hr>
</li>
<li>Now make sure that a Joystick Controller is firmly plugged in to the
LEFT jack. LEFT. That's the hand you don't write with. Unless, of
course, you're left-handed. Then it's the one that you DO write with.
If you don't know how to write, go get someone competent to perform this
step.
<li>Then insert the cartridge gently, but firmly, into the cartridge
slot. Frankly, if you need help here, you probably ought to go play
with something a little less challenging.</li>
<li>Now turn on the console. I realize this is a stretch, but we're
assuming that it has been hooked up to the TV, that the TV is plugged
in, turned on, tuned to the right channel, et cetera, et cetera.</li>
<li>You should now be presented with the opening screen of <i>Fellowship
of the Ring</i>. If not, take this cartridge back to wherever you
bought it and whine until they give you a refund. Now take the refund
money, and invest it all in <a href="http://www.enron.com">Enron</a>
stock.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>Instructions for the Less Stupid</b>
<ol>
<li>In each location of the game, you will initially be presented with
the "movement" menu. By pointing your joystick in a direction and then
pressing the button, you can attempt to travel in the corresponding
compass direction.</li>
<table bgcolor="#eeeeee">

</table>
</li>
<li>
If the joystick is centered when you press the button, you will be
presented with the "action" menu. This menu will let you <b>GO</b>,
<b>TAKE</b>, <b>GIVE</b>, <b>USE</b>, <b>TALK</b>,or <b>INVENTORY</b>.
Move the joystick left or right to choose among these options, and press
the fire button to select the correct action. <b>GO</b> returns you to
the "movement" menu.
<li>
If <b>GIVE</b>, <b>USE</b>, or <b>INVENTORY</b> is selected, moving the
joystick left or right will cycle through the objects currently held in
your inventory, allowing you to choose the one to <b>GIVE</b> or
<b>USE</b> (selecting an object from <b>INVENTORY</b> has no effect
other than to return you to the "movement" menu).
</li>

<h2>
The Making of <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>
</h2>
<h3>Why?</h3>
The first question anyone asks upon seeing this game is "Why?" I'm not
sure I have a good answer, but here goes.
<p>
Just before the movie version of <i>Fellowship</i> was released at the
end of 2001, the long-lost Parker Brothers cartridge was "discovered"
and made available on Atari Age. This in itself is an interesting story
and prompted me to wonder, first, how long whoever had the image had
been sitting on it waiting until the time was ripe to release it, and
second, whether the game was real at all, or whether it was a modern
recreation designed to be consistent with the extant Parker Brothers
marketing materials.
<p>
I suspect that it really is a legitimate prototype of the game; if it
were a fake, the same goal could have been achieved with much less work
with a far less playable demo. The game itself is not bad, and
certainly could be a (somewhat schematic) representation of the first
half of <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>.
<p>
About this time I was kicking around looking for another IF project to
do. After having the Golden Banana of Discord shamefully snatched from
my mouth by <i>The Gostak</i> in the 2001 IF-Comp, I was out for
revenge. The name of that revenge, as is well-known, is <i>Mentula
Macanus: Apocolocyntosis</i>. However, I bogged down in Latin.h (and
am, in fact, still bogged down). For fun I tried playing Greg
Troutman's seminal Atari 2600 text adventure, <i>Dark Mage</i>, and
discovered that the source code for the 4K version was available.
<p>
The source even contained instructions on how to modify the map file to
produce a different game. I got to thinking about what the "real" Atari
<i>Lord of the Rings</i> game should look like, and how things might
have been different in a world in which the Great Video Game Crash had
never happened, and in which Infocom had continued to reign supreme as
the entertainment software giant. In short, a world in which text
adventures on the 2600 were hot-selling titles.
<p>
I began fooling around with the map file, creating an Atari text
adventure. For details on this, see the "How" section. Around this
time, I became aware of the existence of the IntroComp. A two-room
version of my game seemed just the thing, and was easy to write.
<p>
The rest of the game was created mostly as a way to unwind on business
trips; you can only watch so much HBO in interchangeable hotel rooms
before wanting to do something a little more creative. After getting
the basic plot hashed out, I went back and modified the engine (in
z26.asm) to allow me to exert a little more control over the game.
<p>
The full version of <i>Dark Mage</i> is 8K. My game, and the source
that's available for <i>Dark Mage</i>, are 4K. Obviously, I could have
fit a lot more game in 8k. However, moving to 8K was unacceptable to me
for three reasons. First, I didn't want to have to figure out how to do
the bank switching tricks necessary to do an 8k cart and then how to
split memory accesses, although I suspect that the "right answer" is
simply to leave the font and default verb stuff in the bottom bank and
switch banks whenever you want to read a string from z26.map (thus
leaving almost all of the second 4k for user text).
<p>
Second (although related to the first), the architecture of the Atari
expects a 4k cartridge; although some of the earlier games were only 2k,
and many later ones were 8k or even 16k, <i>Adventure</i>, <i>Basic
Programming</i>, <i>Yar's Revenge</i> and <i>Pitfall</i> fit into 4k.
To use larger carts you need to do some sort of bank-switching
technique. The actual architecture of the 2600 expects a 4K ROM, and
128 bytes of RAM. Page 0 and Page 1 are mapped into the same block of
RAM, and the bottom 128 bytes is used by the TIA for access to the
switches and controllers. The top 128 bytes of that page is both your
RAM and your stack.
<p>
Using more memory therefore struck me as cheating. Once you
say that adding a bank of memory to bring it up to 8K is OK, well, then,
why not go to a 16K, or a 32K, or a 64K model (all of which existed in
actual 2600 carts)? And once you've allowed that, why not posit a 1M
extension that works analogously to the 64K but with two layers of
indirection (that is, two 4-bit multiplexers chained together)? Define
some pages to be RAM, some to be ROM (as some Atari, CBS, and M-Network
games did) and then you could have a whole z8-size game implemented on
the Atari (<i>I will buy a case of beer for anyone who implements even
a z3 interpreter on the 2600</i>). In short, this removes the restrictions
that make it an interesting project. (Although it would add some
complexity to make it interesting in a different way.)
<p>
The final reason is the most important. I have a 2600, but not
an EPROM burner. However, I do have a Supercharger. The Supercharger
is a cartridge created by Arcadia (later Starpath) which combined a
whopping 6k of RAM with an A/D converter and a 1/8" mono audio plug.
You plugged this into a cassette player and played tapes into the
system; because the available memory was somewhat larger than the
standard Atari cartridge, and all of it was writeable (remember, the
Atari VCS only had 128 bytes of RAM!), you got the opportunity for some
pretty astounding (by the standards of 1982) games.
<p>
The game is a lot more fun if you play it on the iron. Sure, emulators
are convenient, but it just isn't the same. There's no such thing as a
standard 6k cartridge size, but the Supercharger is perfectly capable of
loading most 2k and 4k cartridge images and playing them. So if I made
the game a 4k image, I could develop it for an emulator, but then pipe
it into the Supercharger and play it on the actual console. Further,
this lets me burn it into a 2532 EPROM if I ever want to actually put
the game in a real, honest-to-goodness cartridge. Check <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/hozervideo/">Hozer Video</a>: Randy at
Hozer is happy to manufacture cartridges. They will cost you $11 per
cartridge.
<p>
<h4>Game Design Stuff</h4>
For the curious, what I changed in <i>Dark Mage</i> was the
following (some spoilers here, so skip it if you want to remain
unspoiled):<br>
<ol>
<li>I made USE actually remove the item after use, just like GIVE. This
was necessary to make Moria work right, so you can't resurrect Gandalf
by using Sting multiple times. Thanks to Robb Sherwin for pointing this
out.</li>
<li>However, USING or GIVING the Ring must not make it disappear.
You're stuck with it.</li>
<li>I made setting a trigger flag clear all other trigger flags,
so that you can't go backwards. (Instead of taking the logical OR of
the value at the trigger location and the new trigger flag, I simply
replaced the value with the new trigger flag.) Poor form in the general
case, but given the, er, rather linear nature of the game, dramatically
necessary.</li>
<li>You have to USE the Ring multiple times; thus the flag has to get
unset between uses. Since USE is always followed by TALK, TALK was the
obvious place to remove the Ring-has-been-USEd flag.</li>
<li>I changed the colors so the actual scheme looks more like it did on
Stella before Stella got colors close to right.</li>
<li>I shortened the Introduction by one screen. Whoop-de-do.</li>
</ol>
My reference for the mods necessary (thankfully not timing-dependent)
was Rodney Zaks' marvellous <i>Programming the 6502</i> (Sybex, 1979).
<p>
I actually think that this is about the most faithful interpretation of
<i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> that it's possible to do given the following
constraints:
<ol>
<li>4K ROM, 128 bytes RAM. You'll notice that the manual is five times
the size of the cartridge.</li>
<li>Classic text adventure format: all program output is text.</li>
<li>Actually a playable game, with meaningful choices on the player's
part and puzzles, however lame.</li>
<li>Maximum screen size 9 lines of 12 columns each. (This is now 13 by
12, thanks to Thomas Jentzsch's modifications; however, I didn't want to
edit all my text, so I stuck with my original format.)</li>
</ol>
<h3>
How?
</h3>
The fundamental component of all of this is <a href="http://www.io.com/~nickb/atari/bin/z26.zip">Greg Troutman's source
to <i>Dark Mage</i></a>. This is the basic engine for a 2600 text
adventure; Greg has done all the work of representing strings, and
getting the output engine done (the trickiest part of any Atari game),
and implementing the verbs, and so on. It's really a pretty amazing
piece of work.
<p>
Thomas Jentzsch helped a lot, too, by finding a way to represent strings
a little more compactly, a way to squeeze more text on the screen, and a
fix so that the game runs at 262 scan lines and is therefore absolutely
legal and in-spec NTSC. If you want to take advantage of his fixes,
you'll need to base your game off the <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>
source code rather than the original <i>Dark Mage</i>.
<p>
Of course, to do anything with it, you're going to need DASM, which is
the assembler that understands this syntax. I was able to find DASM
2.12 source, which built with only minor Makefile tweaking under Linux, at
<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/micro/commodore/programming/unix/dasm21204.zip">this site</a>.
<p>
To convert the BIN file to a WAV suitable for playing into a
Supercharger, I used Rob Colbert's <a href="
http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/zip/makewav4.1.tar.gz">makewav</a>.
I used BladeEnc to rip the file to mp3.
<p>
Note that even if you are doing a straight-ahead replacement of z26.map,
you will need to change at least one routine in z26.asm. This is the
GameStart routine starting on line 263. You need to put your starting
location and your beginning inventory together, and load the appropriate
description for the starting room.
<p>
Once you've done this, it's really easy. The command to compile the
cartridge, for instance, is simply:
<br>
<b>
<tt>
dasm z26.asm -f3 -ofotr.bin
</tt>
</b>
<br>
The only tricky thing is that the syntax of dasm expects the flags after
the filename, which is the wrong way around for a Unix tool. There's
also no real documentation for dasm, but then there doesn't really need
to be.
<h2>
How to Play, <i>Really</i>
</h2>
<h3>
Emulator
</h3>
In all probability you're playing this on an Atari emulator. If you
don't have one already, I recommend <a href="http://www.redlinelabs.com/stella/">Stella</a>. There's probably
a port for whatever platform you're using. I use stella.x11 in Linux, and
it works fine. Please be aware that the text is a lot less flickery if
you play either on an actual console or at least on a computer with an
LCD rather than a CRT display. For me, all I have to do to run the game
is:
<br>
<tt>
stella.x11 fotr.bin
</tt>
<br>
If you're running Windows or DOS, <a href="http://pcae.vg-network.com/">PCAE</a> is also very good.
<h3>
Cartridge
</h3>
Playing on an emulator isn't as much fun as playing on the real iron.
If you have a real Atari, you can order a copy of <i>Fellowship of the
Ring</i> from <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/hozervideo/">Hozer
Video</a>.
<p>
If you're hardcore and have access to an EPROM burner that will let you
burn a 2532 or a 2732, which requires 21 or 25 volts, then you can
certainly create your own cartridge. Randy <a href="http://webpages.charter.net/hozervideo/atari/makecart.html">tells
you how</a>.
<h3>
Supercharger/Cuttle Cart
</h3>
Alternatively, if you have a Supercharger or Cuttle Cart, you can
convert the game to its sonic representation and play it into the
Supercharger. This is how I play it. Robert Colbert has a page about
<a href="http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/makewav.htm">his MakeWAV
utility</a>. My Supercharger won't load "fast load" format games, so
the WAV of this (or any other 4K cartridge) is about 500K. Under Linux,
this is the command I use:
<br>
<tt>
makewav fotr.bin fotr.wav
</tt>
<br>
You can cut that file size by about a factor of 4 by ripping it to an
mp3. I found the lowest bitrate that would allow reliable loading to be
96kbits (as ripped with BladeEnc and played back through Windows Media
Player; I have no idea how this varies with different mp3 encoders and
decoders). On my system this means running:
<br>
<tt>
BladeEnc -rawmono -96 fotr.wav fotr.mp3
</tt>
<br>
At least, it <i>would</i> mean that if possession and use of BladeEnc
weren't illegal in the Land of the Free. So, um, that's what you'd run
on a system that happened to look an awful lot like mine, but in some
country like Thailand where BladeEnc was legal to use.
<p><i>
(As an aside, Bob Colbert has also written a utility called Cheetah that
is to the VCS/Supercharger combo what the Game Genie is to the NES.
Effectively, it's a modified version of the MakeWAV utility that takes a
2k or 4k ROM image and writes a 2k prologue in front of it before
converting it into an audio file to play into the Supercharger. This
prologue gives you the ability to modify any byte in the image, because
it's all loaded into RAM, before you start it. This lets you create new
game variations, turn off the timer in games, and all kinds of neat
hackery. Of course, since you already have the binary image, you could
just zap that directly with a hex editor before making the audio copy
of it, but somehow Cheetah is cooler. Just go to
<a href="http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/super.htm">Bob Colbert's Atari
Development Page</a>)</i>
<h3>
Ripping Games
</h3>
I found that, using an mp3 encoding, every 4k-or-smaller Atari game
whose ROM image is available on the Web will fit in about 50M. Thus
it's quite easy to burn a CD-ROM with mp3 images of the games and have
the ultimate multicart, as long as you have an mp3 player (for instance,
a laptop computer) that can read tracks off a CD (or you could put 99
WAV tracks per CD, if you preferred; this would give you something like
<i>Worship the Woodgrain</i>).
<p>
Only about 70% of games will work with the Supercharger. That
percentage can be boosted by <a href="http://members.cox.net/rcolbert/txt/scmod.txt">modifying the
Supercharger</a>. I now have a second Supercharger, but I haven't done
the modification yet.

<h2>
Disclaimers
</h2>
Yes, I'm perfectly aware that the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> properties
are zealously and jealously guarded by Christopher Tolkien, New Line
Cinema, oodles of money, and Nazgul lawyers.
<p>
However, for at least a couple more years (I hope), parody is still
protected in the United States by the First Amendment. And it is my
contention that this game is parody.
<p>
For starters, on the face of it, an Atari 2600 text adventure is
ridiculous. An Atari 2600 text adventure that attempts to compress
several hundred pages of densely-written prose into a 4K ROM image is
even more ridiculous. It should be obvious even to the dimmest that the
game is not intended as a serious interpretation of one of the most
complex works of fiction ever put on paper, although it may in fact be
about the best one can do given the limitations of the medium.
<p>
<i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> is intended as a gentle spoof of the
retro-gaming community, the mindset that attempts to produce derivative
works in woefully inadequate media, fanfic authors in general, and the
rec.arts.int-fiction and IFMud communities in particular. Hence the
choice of words used, for example, in the Mines of Moria.
<p>
And be thankful that I didn't turn it into a Stiffy Makane
interpretation. For that, you'll have to go to <a href="https://www.livejournal.com/users/cassieclaire">The Secret Diaries
of Cassandra Claire</a>. Still not King.
<p>
<i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> is released as freeware. Feel free to
distribute it as widely as you want. Feel free to create derivative
works based on it. Just maintain credit and attributions, and don't
distribute it for money (not even the cost of distribution) without
checking with me first. Of course, I accept no responsibility for any
loss or damages you may sustain, not even if you burn the game onto an
EPROM and it leaps out of the cartridge, jams itself down your throat,
and then punctures your intestines with its pins, thereby leaving you to
die a hideous and painful death from peritonitis.
