The Fellowship Of The Ring, Atari 2600 Text Adventure Edition
-------------------------------------------------------------

Build it by running `make` in the `src` directory.  You will need
[dasm](https://dasm-assembler.github.io/).

The manual is [here](./doc/manual.html).

I'm working on porting
[makewav](http://www.bjars.com/tools/makewav4.2.zip) into the modern
era.  You don't need it to play the game in emulation--the `bin` file
will suffice.  It's nice if you want to play on a SuperCharger.
